#[[
Simple project setup. There's a fair amount of boiler plate that has to happen
in a particular order around project setup. This function wraps project() and
does the following:

* Changes CMake around so that the output variables follow the /bin and /lib output
  directory convention popular on Gnu.
* Ensures that ARM and 64-bit code are built as position-independent code
* Verifies that the compiler actually supports C++11
* Sets the correct flags to enable C++11 on all platforms
* Ensures compilation happens with visibility set to hidden by default
* Builds fat binaries on mac
* Sets standard_BUILD* variables for consumption later down the line.
* Enforces the project has a VERSION set.
